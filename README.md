# the_green_bicycle

I built out this app as my third project for the Grow with Google/Udacity beginner's android app development course. It's a simple, 6-question quiz app that takes some of the random assembledge I have in my head about absurdist lit. and sticks it into quiz form.

This was a really fun (and at time frustrating) app to build. :)
